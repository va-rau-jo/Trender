# Trender
Shows monthly trends on Spotify when using monthly playlists

# Development
Assuming you have the Trender Server correctly set up, navigate to this folder and run:

`npm install` and `npm start` to run the client locally.

By default, the client runs on localhost:3000, and redirects to the server to retrieve an access token from Spotify (localhost:8888).
