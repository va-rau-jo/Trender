# Trender
Shows monthly trends on Spotify when using monthly playlists

# Development
Assuming you have the Trender Server correctly set up, run:

`npm install` and
`npm start` to start running the server locally.

By default, the server runs on localhost:3000, and redirects to localhost:8888 to retrieve the access token from the server.
